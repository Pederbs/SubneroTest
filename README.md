# Subnero Test
Simple test for verifying that the pyhton API works with subnero modems

#### Trasmitting
Simple test for verifying that the pyhton API (UnetSocket) works for sending and receiving data with subnero modems

#### pubsub
Simple ROS2 program for testing publishing and subscribing to and from topics

#### Sleep
Different strategies for trying to put subnero modem to sleep, ``modem_sleep.py`` works with ```phy << AddScheduledSleepReq()``` but you will have to manualy use the subnero browser interface to remove the sleep schedule that is set with the command



# graycodeCompression
functions that allow conversion form float numbers to graycode of a given bit size.

-``graycode_equivalent(num)``: This function takes an integer num and returns its corresponding Gray code equivalent, which is a binary numeral system where two consecutive values differ in only one digit.

-``graycode(num, bits)``: This function takes an integer num and an integer bits, and returns the Gray code representation of num as a binary string of length bits. Note that this function only works for values of bits less than 10.

-``compress(number, lowerlim, upperlim, bits, gain)``: This function takes a float number, a lower limit lowerlim, an upper limit upperlim, an integer bits, and a gain gain. It returns an integer that represents a compressed version of the original number. The output integer is determined by mapping the range between lowerlim and upperlim to a binary range of length bits, and then scaling that range by gain.

-``gray_to_int(gray_code)``: This function takes a binary string gray_code in Gray code format and converts it to the corresponding integer value.

-``unpack(number, lowerlim, upperlim, bits, gain)``: This function takes an integer number (presumably generated by the compress function), a lower limit lowerlim, an upper limit upperlim, an integer bits, and a gain gain. It returns the original uncompressed float value that was used to generate the input number.
